Blog Momentum is a Blog plugin for Umbraco 7.2+.

The plugin allows you to easily manage blog posts, authors and categories & tags. The idea behind this plugin is to 
keep it as easy as possible to install as well as being easily customisable. Customising doc types / templates is handled 
just as you would with any other of your own custom Doc Types. All Data Types are native Umbraco datatypes to keep the blog 
as future proof as possible.

##How this Repository is structured##

There are 2 main part of the project:

* The UmbracoWebsite folder is a basic install of Umbraco also including the Views and the App_plugin files needed for the project. Using this base install you can then use the package manager to build the plugin ready for installlation into your project.
