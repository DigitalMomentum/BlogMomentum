Blog Momentum is a Blog plugin for Umbraco 7.2+.

The plugin allows you to easily manage blog posts, authors and categories. The idea behind this plugin is to keep it as easy as possible to install as well as being easily extensible. Customising doc types / templates is done just as you would with any other of your own custom Doc Types. All Data Types are native Umbraco datatypes to keep the blog as future proof as possible.

This Wiki will guide you through the installation and integration of the plugin.
